# IOT-Project

The system: Tower Pro Servo connects with Raspberry Pi and is programmed with Python. DHTT22 Digital Temperature Sensor connects to Raspberry Pi with one wire to send temperature data to a terminal and display gauge. Red and green LED bulbs connect to Raspberry Pi to indicate high and low temperatures. Motor Driver IC connects between Pi and DC Motor for fan control. Fan speed automatically adjusts based on temperature changes. Fan turns off if temperature drops below 20 degrees Celsius. Display gauge shows three different temperature levels (High, Medium, Low). MQTT protocol used for message transport between Pi and dashboard. Node-Red dashboard displays latest temperature, past data visualization, and temperature prediction
